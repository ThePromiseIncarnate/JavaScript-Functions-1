// Baladium's Drive with Lyrics by Alex "Man On The Internet" Beckham
// Verse 1
console.log("Once you choose your path, you never go back")
console.log("Fools run, but I will choose to attack")
console.log("The harshest winds waiting for the storm")
console.log("Free us from the chance to mourn!"); 

// Chorus
function chorus() {
    console.log("When you look to the wind and you touch the sky");
    console.log("When you look at a world that dreams not to fly");
    console.log("Will the touchdown rip the tears from your eyes?");
    console.log("Will it give you reason and drive?");
    
    console.log("With the wind at our back, we are flying free");
    console.log("In the sky, the one thing they won’t take from me");
    console.log("Soaring on to the place that I’m meant to be");
    console.log("I will fly!")
    console.log("I will fly!")
}

chorus();

// Verse 2
console.log("When the charming ends, the cobra will strike");
console.log("The sun falls, so launches the dragonfly!");
console.log("The harshest winds trapped in which you swing");
console.log("Upturn your everything!");
